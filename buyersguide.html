  <p class="normalContent">Some people will always chase the newest and latest model of something,
    and others don't mind something a bit older. If you're looking for a bargain
  while still not missing out on too much, I currently recommend buying: </p>
  <h3>CORVETTE C7 GENERATION</h3>
  <img src="./images/corvettebuyers.jpg" id="buyersGuideImage" alt="">
  <p class="normalContent">Here's why: </p>
  <div class="ulist-container">

  <ul class="mylist">
    <li>A used 2017 Corvette Stingray Z51 Coupe should <a href="https://www.kbb.com/chevrolet/corvette/2017/stingray-z51-coupe-2d/?category=coupe&condition=good&intent=buy-used&mileage=24544&pricetype=private-party&vehicleid=419704">run you about $45,000.</a>
    I chose 2017 because it's about half the life-span of the C7 generation (which only lasted from 2014-2019) and I also chose the Z51 package because I think the package adds some real nice touches to the base model. We're talking
  455 horsepower for a $45k car, vs 490 horsepower for a C8 which will probably run you upwards of $100,000 because dealers are marking up the price. The hype is real, and dealers pounce on it.</li>
  <li>You can still find C7s with respectable mileage. You'll find more used weekend cars than not, so you're pretty much getting something new for a bargain of a price. Typical mileage for the 2017
  Corvette for example was 24,500 miles. Still a baby!</li>
  <li>C8 is still arguably new and 2021 is only its second year model. Problems are yet to come? Who knows, but it's generally not advised to
  buy a first year model, unless you have money to blow and you don't care for being the guinea pig. This is also the first time Chevrolet has gone with a mid-engine. Front engine with a rear wheel drive
is tried and true, so with a C7 you'll be hard pressed to go wrong.</li>
